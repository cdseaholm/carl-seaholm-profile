# My Portfolio

This portfolio is a showcase of my previous roles, current projects, and hobbies. It's built with a variety of modern web technologies and designed to be scalable and easy to update.

## Overview

The portfolio is divided into three main sections:

1. **Previous Roles/Work**: A detailed look at my professional history and the roles I've held.
2. **Current Projects**: An overview of the projects I'm currently working on, with links to live demos and source code.
3. **Hobbies**: A personal section where I share my current hobbies.

## Technology Stack

This portfolio is built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: NextJS, Javascript, Typescript, TailwindCSS, React
- **Backend**: Prisma, PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Data Fetching**: Apollo, GraphQL
- **Miscellaneous**: Lucia, Gray-matter

## Architecture

The architecture of this portfolio is designed to be scalable and easy to update. While most of the data is currently hardcoded due to budget constraints, the structure is in place to easily transition to a server-based setup. This would allow for real-time updates and a more dynamic user experience.

## Running Locally

To run this portfolio on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`

The portfolio will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
It is also available at http://www.carlseaholm.com without the auth/DB functionality.

## Future Plans

As funds become available, I plan to transition to a server-based setup. This will allow for real-time updates and a more dynamic user experience. Stay tuned for updates!
